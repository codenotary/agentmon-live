description: Change AgentMon Live's settings when the user asks, such as hidden pane sections, language, advisor mode or budget, file-size guide, base-branch check, or learning. Use for requests like "hide the usage box", "switch AgentMon to German", "turn off the done gate".

# Changing AgentMon Live's settings

The settings are in `~/.claude/settings.json` (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/settings.json`), under:

```json
"pluginConfigs": {
  "agentmon-live@agentmon-live": {
    "options": { "hiddenSections": "usage, skills" }
  }
}
```

Edit only this plugin's `options` object. Leave all other keys as they are. Create `pluginConfigs` or the plugin entry if it is missing. Leave out an option to keep its default.

| Option | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `language` | `en`, `de`, `fr`, `es`, `zh`, `ja` | the terminal's (`LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES`, `LANG`), else `en` |
| `hiddenSections` | comma-separated: `tasks`, `steps`, `insights`, `skills`, `advisor`, `changes`, `usage` | `""` |
| `refreshRate` | `live`, `5`, `15`, `30`, `60` (seconds between pane redraws) | `live` |
| `layout` | `calm` or `classic` | `calm` |
| `advisorModel` | any model id | `claude-fable-5-1` |
| `advisorMode` | `all` (done gate plus Fable), `gate` (done gate, no model), `off` | `all` |
| `advisorBudget` | most Fable calls per session, `0` for no limit | `30` |
| `sizeLimit` | bytes before Focus suggests splitting a file, `0` for off | `20000` |
| `sizeExclude` | comma-separated globs the size guide skips | `""` |
| `learning` | `on` or `off` | `on` |
| `debugLog` | `on` or `off` | `on` |
| `gitPollMinutes` | minutes between base-branch checks, `0` for off | `5` |
| `gitFetch` | `true` runs `git fetch` for the base before each check | `false` |
| `web` | `on` or `off` (the local web view) | `on` |
| `webPort` | first port to try, 1024 to 65535 | `47311` |
| `webOpenOnStart` | `true` opens the browser once per session | `false` |
| `webToken` | `on` or `off`: whether the web view's port lets only the user's own account in | `on` |

The Focus box, Running now and the history always show. They cannot be hidden.

The mod reads its options at each prompt and after this edit, so no reload is needed. Only `debugLog`, `gitPollMinutes`, `gitFetch`, `web`, `webPort`, `webOpenOnStart` and `webToken` wait for a new session.
